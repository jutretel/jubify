TRAAAAW128F429D538.h5,Casual,I Didn't Mean To,"Verse One:

Alright I might
Have had a little glare when I stared at ya ho
But I didn't know she was like that
She stared right back
My niggas warnin me that she was comin on to me
I react like a mack do I act cool
Just to test her cause I ain't no jester
I suggest her and her friend be outtie
Cause I don't want to make my pals get rowdy
And doubt me our friendship
But when lips touch
I go crazy in the clutch
Sorta like schitzo I forgets my bros and pals over gals
I didn't mean to but when you fiend you do
Strange things for the denim no matter who's in em
Grab a flooze then I'm in traffic
Don't laugh it might be your girl that I'm talkin about
I didn't mean to

Chorus: Repeat 2X

It ain't my fault that your girl got caught
It ain't my fault that your girl got caught (I didn't mean to)

Verse Two:

Another incident when I went
Way beyond what I should of done
John should of stopped before them drawers dropped
But I didn't ain't no quittin
Really didn't care who's girl I was hittin
I admit skinz ain't a reason to lose friends
But then again I didn't know, sorry
Accept apologies and live on
Are we goin hold grudges well oh fudge
Its a new year and I do fear
Ya actions ya actin shy
I mean ya need to be smackin
That hoe
Instead of tryin to front on me ya know
Thats exactly how I'm goin to be ya know
I run my game on any G ya know
Cause we the most entertainin
I meant to blame women
For makin me do what the Ak seem to
When you call I screen you
I didn't mean to

Chorus


Verse Three:

Why do fools be schememin dreamin
Actin like demons
Niggas don't give a fuck
Because they beat shit
To many girls front cute
When they want loot
They tell lies the swell guys
Can peep it and thats weak shit
Thats why I run game on every freak I get
Born in Oakland grew up pumpin Too Short
I know the rules on the flooze so who's short
I once had a ho who smoked blunts yo
She tried to get me so I looked at the front door
And now shes not with me so forget it
But every once in a while I'll hit it
And it happened to be your girl
I didn't mean to and I been through
Your relationship and I hate dumb dips
But I really can't trip when they ride my tip
I didn't mean to

Every girl is a something girl
Every girl is a something girl
Every girl is a something girl
She's got something
Every girl is a something girl
Every girl has a somehing smile
Every girl is a something girl
For a while
If I had three wishes I know mine
I would not ask the stars to shine
I wouldn't ask for gems or pearls
I'd ask for the something girls
Every girl is a something girl
From the whites of her eyes
To the tip of a curl
Every girl sends a something boy
With that something
When this old world won't treat you right
You're not feeling yourself tonight
Think of someone you can do
Relax and let that something through
Every girl is a something girl
She's got she's got something",Rock,happy,1982

And now I walk away from it, it's better done secret
I never mouthed those words away, I wouldn't cause concern
Die in a crossfire runaway none of this exists
Someone is killing me

Turn him away, lay over there
His limb is red, I have all clear
Settle the wave I'm on my way
Dreaming of red, memories are worst

I feel abrasive worn and tired, don't think I could win
Take me to a place I adore and then seal me in
I'm not the one I swear I'm not, no matter how I felt
Die in a crossfire runaway, face the ash again
Someone is killing me",Rock,sad,2007

Well the time has come to celebrate
You and me girl so sounds great
Cause tonight will be alright

TRAABLR128F423B7E3.h5,Blue Rodeo,Floating,"Lead Vocal by Greg

Well, these late night conversations
Leave a strange taste,
Like french cigarettes.
And these coloured drinks
that you keep on throwin' at me
Just keep on reminding me
I came to forget.

So now every night
You insist on reminding me
Of my lost possibilities
And the stains on the wall.
Well, I don't mean to complain
But it hurts just the same.
And now both of us know
The leaves will fall on their own.

Just throw me a line
That's all that I ask
Well, it's sink or swim and I'm goin' fast
I need love and it's you
And I feel like William Holden floating in a pool.

Yea, you tell me
Life is for living
It's best in the giving
But it's so hard to be free.
Still I do my best
But you refuse my gift
And now all that we share
Is a collection of tears.

Just throw me a line
That's all that I ask
Well, it's sink or swim and I'm going fast
I need love and it's you
And I feel like William Holden floating in a pool.

Who knows, maybe someday it will all come true

for every living thing under the sun

Rest your head and shut your eyes
Empty ambition blankets the sky...
I'm thinking 'bout another world

Tonight
So drop the gown the game's over just push your face into the fight and it breaks my heart like dancing up all night ride so high we both start thinking 'bout another world tonight
And it feels so wrong like nothing we've ever...
Felt before

The stranger's candy takes you where you ought to be
In broken alleys, in the back of every street
Close your eyes tonight
Baby you can have it
Baby you can have it

Ooh baby gnaw me
Down to the bone
Soon you'll find I'm never gonna take you back home
Well there's so much you never told me
And there's not much I want to know
'cause your pretty face will do just fine
You'll be the star...

Of my every last show
Let's go for a long ride I'll show you places you won't ever want to leave

The stranger's candy takes you where you ought to be
In broken alleys, in the back of every street

Ran off the track yes once again, the vibe is sending
So far from where I might have been, this message pending

Ain't no love
Ain't no love
Ain't no love

We're missing in action living in a time when it's in fashion
To be gun flashing, blasting that's why we ain't lasting
All fastened, strapped ready for rivals harassing
Looking over your shoulder ducking cars that are passing
In my rumbo you hear that latin lingo
Guns shoot through at pachucos fuckin? sickos
With four nickels nobody walks around single
Get caught slipping they'll pull your card from a window
It's that simple locals get gaffled by barrio locos
Steal their spanish grease making them shed a tear like willie bobo
Over dollars, chains and rings things that are worth poco
A coco's out there stealing 'cause they're fiending for perico
A head crack will strike and attack for a sack
Pawn or sell your shit to buy a rock and bring that high back
That's why I strap it's my defense against those
Who are committing defense randomly becoming foes?
Shit is survival of fittest testing who's biggest and realest on the street
Feel this beware of killers, stealers and dealers
Rebel guerillas striking on policemen who give us
Hard times in the city where no love is with us

Ain't no love
Ain't no love
In the city?

stone by stone
dismantle the will of a man
strip his flesh and bone

Reach out your hand
the moment comes
blade catches the light of your eyes
the man slowly comes undone

Nobody noticed
no one saw a thing
all turned a blind eye to the fallen
and the bad luck he brings

You wake in the morning after
the sky's a color that you can't see
friends have fallen by the wayside
why isn't anyone talking to me
get those funny looks in the market
people you loved just stare
wander on with your hands in your pockets
even your girlfriend don't care

They've all come to watch the emperor
They've all come to watch the emperor
They've all come to watch the emperor

To watch the emperor fall

One part truth
three parts deceit
two parts shit that you made up
add passion for heat

Did ya hear he said this
can you believe he done that
can you believe the nerve of the man

Unsuspicious, nobody cares for you
You're so fucked up again

You laugh at nothin' in the pouring rain
You try to tell yourself you're not insane
You fool, I hate you sometimes

Hey

It's drippin' off your face
And you're losin' your precious mind

But send me a postcard if you get that far
You got a couple pennies in your rusty jar
The truth, you've been gone for awhile

And it's hard lookin' at you when you look that way
With your one night stands and your sleep all days
Ooh, you're such a slut sometimes

As the smoke surrounds my head, the sauna

Saying things, saying things that
I got something sticking in my eye
Got something sticking in my eye
Got something sticking in my eye

I feel unusual from thinking
About the underground decay, God help me
Kill beneath the camera, watch the world begin to cry
It's not from pity
It comes from what's been sticking in my eye

I should learn to be man

If I should make the change
I'd love to pull the wires from the wall!

Carbed apart the madness that I stumbled from
But she fell away
She fell away
Shed me like a skin
She fell away
Left me holding everything

Once the road lay open like a girl
And we drank and laughed and threw the bottle over
But she fell away
She fell away
I did not see the cracks form
As I knelt to pray
I did not see the crevice yawn, no

Sometimes
At night I feel the end it is at hand
My pistol going crazy in my hand
For she fell away
O she fell away
Walked me th the brink
The fell away
I did not see her fall
To better days
Sometimes I wonder was she ever there at all

To take to flight

Aim for the burning sun

Keep moving way up high
You see the light
It shines forever
Sail through the crimson skies
The purest light
The light that sets you free...

Sail through the wind and rain tonight
You're free to fly tonight
